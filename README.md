It is expected of developers to have a blog where they express their technical ventures. I was asked to write one myself but I had been putting it off for a long time. Finally, I have this blog site built using GatsbyJS + Netlify.

### How this works ?
If you're learning web developement, I'd suggest you to create your blog site on your own from scratch. But I tried the fastest and easiest way possible to maintain a blog.
I was suggested to write blogs in markdown which could be rendered using static site generator. So I chose gatsby, since its fast and has inbuilt features for markdown.
Later, I read a tutorial about integrating Netlify.
Basically, I have a route which allows me to write blog posts in Markdown. Then, Netlify takes the file and publishes it for me.
Since, Netlify is integrated with Github, my Markdown file is pushed into my Github repo. Gatsby generates my website including that markdown file which is then deployed by Netlify.
